This repository was created with the aim of assisting companies and independent researchers about Tactics, Techniques and Procedures adopted by Ransomware Operators/Groups active or not and also threat actors that are operating in society.

In addition to mapping Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, I am inserting data on commands, tools, useful locations for researching artifacts and others.

The main focus is to assist organizations and individual researchers on each type of actor, providing a summary of their trajectory and additional information that can be used.
